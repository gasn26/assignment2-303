### Instructions
The main function in the project has various test cases set up, but does not make use of user input as a demo.  
Arrays have error checking when adding and removing elements to make sure the size and index are within proper bounds.  
Employees have basic and more advanced constructors that attempt to make their profiles more complete. Professionals and Nonprofessionals both stem from Employee and make use of virtual functions and functions of their own.
